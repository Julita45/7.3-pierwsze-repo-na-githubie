		<h1>Ray Charles - Come Rain Or Come Shine</h1>
		<p>I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you 
		Come rain or come shine 
		High as a mountain, deep as a river 
		Come rain or come shine 
		</p>
		<p>I guess when you met me 
		It was just one of those things 
		But don't you ever bet me 
		'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me 
		</p>
		<p>
		You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me 
		Come rain or come shine 
		We'll be happy together, unhappy together 
		Now won't that be just fine 	
		</p>
