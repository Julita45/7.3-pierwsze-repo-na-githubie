		<h2>Come Rain Or Come Shine</h2>
		<p>I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you <br> Come rain or come shine <br> High as a mountain, deep as a river <br> Come rain or come shine</p>
		<p>I guess when you met me <br> It was just one of those things <br> But don't you ever bet me <br> 'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me </p>
		<p> You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me <br> Come rain or come shine <br> We'll be happy together, unhappy together <br> Now won't that be just fine
