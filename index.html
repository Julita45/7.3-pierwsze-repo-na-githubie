	<h1>Ray Charles - Come Rain Or Come Shine</h1>
	<p>I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you 
Come rain or come shine 
High as a mountain, deep as a river 
Come rain or come shine </p>
	<p>I guess when you met me 
It was just one of those things 
But don't you ever bet me 
		'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me </p>
